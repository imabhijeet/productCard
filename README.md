## My process

### Built with
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox and transform
- Media Queries
- User Interface

### What I learned
While working on this project, I refreshed my knowledge of HTML5 and CSS3. I brushed up on concepts like flexbox for creating flexible layouts, simplifying the alignment and distribution of elements within the container. I utilized media queries to craft responsive and user-friendly designs for the project. Additionally, I learned about some new CSS properties that I had heard of before but didn't know how to apply in real-world projects.

### Continued development
The concepts and topics that made me feel uncomfortable were related to flexbox properties. I struggled a lot to align my image at the desired position. However, after going through various articles from MDN and W3Schools, I managed to complete this project.
